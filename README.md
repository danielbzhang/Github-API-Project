# Github-API-Project
It's a simple jQuery application that has one input and a submit button. Inside that input, the user will enter a SHA_HASH and we're going to see the person who's associated with that commit.
Each time a SHA_HASH is entered and searched for, the associated user's login and image will disaplay.
